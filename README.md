# rppg-project
Blood Pressure Prediction Using Facial Features & rPPG Signals
 Project Overview
This project aims to estimate systolic and diastolic blood pressure using facial images/videos captured from a webcam. It utilizes remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) for non-contact feature extraction and applies deep learning models (CNN, LSTM) for real-time blood pressure estimation and monitoring.

ðŸ”§ Features
Real-time face and eye detection using OpenCV

rPPG signal extraction for pulse-based blood pressure estimation

Deep learning models for blood pressure prediction


Pyqt6-based GUI for user-friendly interaction

Executable application created using InstallForge

ðŸ›  Installation
Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:

Python 

OpenCV (pip install opencv-python)

TensorFlow/Keras (pip install tensorflow)

PyTorch (optional, if using alternative models)

Flask/Django (if deploying as a web API)

Pyqt6 (for the GUI)

Setup Instructions
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the application:

bash
Copy code
python app.py  # If using Flask/Django

ðŸ“Š Dataset


Custom dataset collected using a infrared camera and BP monitor

Features include facial images, rPPG signals, and BP readings

ðŸ§  Model Architecture
CNN for facial feature extraction

LSTM for temporal signal analysis (rPPG processing)

MLP for final blood pressure estimatio

Data augmentation and preprocessing techniques applied

ðŸ–¥ Usage
Webcam Mode: Detects face, extracts rPPG, and predicts BP in real time

Image Input Mode: Allows users to upload facial images for BP estimation

GUI Mode: A user-friendly Pyqt6 interface for easy operation
